This repository contains stuff that I did during the first semester. 
The larger projects include the calculator, which is for the most part functional but contains a few noteable errors
edgy_sketchy, which is an etch-a-sketch program
Tempconverter, a program that converts fahrenheit to Celcius
Though the majority of these are minor assignments, the ones mentioned are the most noteworthy.
